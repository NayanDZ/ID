# Insecure Deserialization

### What is serialization?
Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes.
- Write complex data to inter-process memory, a file, or a database
- Send complex data over a network

Deserialization is the process of restoring this byte stream to a fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state as when it was serialized.
